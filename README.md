## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

It's been a while since I've built a website from scratch so this project was a refresher project for me. I also worked on creating my own boilerplate based off aspects I liked from other boilerplates. In previous projects I've worked on I've used a boilerplate that was set up with gulp, so this was my first attempt at using prepos to help compile my scss to css. 


### Continued development

I used flexbox on this project but I'd like to explore using grid layouts as well. Historically I've found grid layouts to be a little bit more fickle in getting the alignments I want whereas flexbox seems to do more what I want right out of the box.
